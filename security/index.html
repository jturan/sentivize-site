        <h4>Data Security Measures</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>HIPAA Equivalence: We implement safeguards that are designed to be equivalent to those required under HIPAA
                compliance standards.</li>
            <li>Secure Transmission: We use industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure the secure transmission of your
                data between your device and our servers. This helps protect your information from unauthorized access or
                interception.</li>
            <li>Access Control: We employ stringent access control measures to limit access to your data. Only authorized
                personnel, such as healthcare professionals involved in your care, have access to your information, and
                their access is strictly regulated and monitored.</li>
            <li>Data Storage: Your personal and medical information is stored on secure servers with multiple layers of
                protection. These servers are housed in highly secure data centers, and we regularly monitor and update our
                systems to maintain the highest level of security.</li>
            <li>System Audits: We conduct regular audits of our systems to identify and address any potential
                vulnerabilities or security risks. This helps us ensure the ongoing security and integrity of your data.
            </li>
            <li>Employee Training: Our team members undergo comprehensive training on data security and privacy best
                practices. They are aware of their responsibilities in handling and protecting your information and are
                committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Data Breach Response</h4>
        <p>
            In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have established incident response procedures to promptly address and
            mitigate any potential impact. Our team is trained to respond quickly and effectively to minimize any harm and
            notify the appropriate authorities and individuals affected, as required by law.
        </p>

        <h4>Third-Party Security</h4>
        <p>
            When we work with third-party service providers or vendors, we carefully evaluate their security practices to
            ensure they meet our stringent standards. We only engage with trusted partners who demonstrate a commitment to
            data security and compliance with applicable regulations.
        </p>
